## Task(s)

1. Individually or in pairs, you will be putting together a two-part proposal package for a potential client as below.  There will be a roughly equal number of individuals/groups for each Client.

_Your teacher might set up this differently - see your teacher for more details_

## Clients

### Client 1
> Hello! I am looking for some help with regards to my computing needs at the office.  I will need one computer for myself, and there will be contractors that come in and will be using their own laptops.  They will need connectivity to the network printer while they are in the building.  
>
> For our computer, our needs are as follows:
> * We need the fastest, most graphically powerful computer that you can create for us.
> * We need a lot of space on the computer, and an external hard drive would also prove useful.
> * We will require a Wacom tablet for artwork.
> * We like consistency and prefer Windows, but if we were to take on Linux, it would have to be a user-friendly distribution.
> * We need a new network printer, just something to print off black and white copies of our work, as we get our colour prints done professionally off-site.
>
> We create Game Art Design (designing characters, settings etc) for a local game creation company (Client #2), so we will need to be able share files and chat with them easily.  Do you have any suggestions?


### Client 2
> Hi!
>
> I am cheap... super cheap.  I need a computer that is powerful enough to play the newest games, but I only need to run Linux.  We love tinkering with programs, so we are okay with setting things up on Linux.
>
> As a computer programmer, myself and my colleagues in the office will need the best network system and connectivity that you can set up for us.  We need to be able to share files and chat with our artists (Client #1), but also amongst ourselves (anything you can suggest for programmers would be great).
>
> The programs we tend to make are highly graphically intensive, and are going to be taking up a lot of space. We will also need a network storage system (NAS) to hold on to all of the assets that we are getting created for us by our artists (Client #1).
>
> We also tend to prefer mechanical keyboards, and a mouse with many button options so that we can set up macros to speed up our work.

### Client 3
> Greetings.
>
> I am a realtor, looking for someone to upgrade my computer setup.  I work out of my home office but am frequently out on the road.      
>
> For a desktop computer, I don't do much beyond word processing, spreadsheets, internet browsing and some light graphic design (brochures).  I would love to have a dual-screen setup, so I can refer to documents on one screen while working on another.  I also need a network setup for the whole house (approximately 2500 squared feet) that my family can use, color printer and the ability to share small PDF files with colleagues and clients. 
>
> When I am out of the house I need some sort of portable computer to do the same things, except for the graphic design.  It would be handy to allow my clients to sign documents digitally, without having to print documents on the go.  A decent digital camera would be helpful for taking photos of my listings.
>
> I'd prefer not to spend too much on all of this, but I'm willing to go higher if you can convince me that it's worth it.


## Part 1 - Hardware

### Computer Build

* Choose individual components to build a computer for your client.  Include part type, product name, where you plan to buy the item and price.  [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) is an excellent resource.

* Provide short reasoning for choosing each component, using specific terminology.  You will also have to know the purpose of each component (ask your teacher how to demonstrate this).

### Network

* Choose a type of network (wireless vs wired) for your client, as well as any components they would need.  Include part type, product name, where you plan to buy the item and price.

* Also choose any networking applications (file sharing/chat) that the client should use.

* Provide short reasoning for all of your choices.

## Part 2 - Software / Operating System

* Choose software (non-networking) and an Operating System that is appropriate for your client.  Include current pricing (hyperlink).  

* Provide short reasoning for each choice, including some potential downsides.

* Explain why preventative maintenance is important, and describe techniques that are available in your OS of choice.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

This is the application of the knowledge learned/researched from the [previous assignment](./Hardware-Network-OS-Research-and-Report).

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Computer Systems_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to describe hardware [and software] components and assess usersâ€™ needs thereof.
  * We are learning to use software products and operating system software.

| I can describe the functions of the internal, network, and/or peripheral components of a computer | | | |
| I can assess user computing needs and select appropriate hardware and networking components for different situations | | | |

### Part 2 - Software / Operating System

| Success Criteria | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can assess user computing needs and select appropriate software for different situations  | | | |
