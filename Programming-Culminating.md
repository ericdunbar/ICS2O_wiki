## Task(s)

Create a program using **Processing** that displays **your name** on the screen that shows your understanding of all of the Processing concepts you learned up to this point in the course.  Do **not** just use the ```text()``` function to place the name on the screen.  You are _forming_ the name using the concepts learned.

* You must have at least 5 letters displayed, add additional letters/symbols if needed.
* If you have a long name, see your teacher to negotiate a shortened version.

See an example [here](http://mrseidel.com/culminating/2O_Culminating_Seidel.gif).

### Concepts to cover
* Documentation (header, comments)
* Input and Output (keyboard, mouse, drawing shapes and colours etc)
* Variables (custom and built in)
* If Statements (including Else If, Else, &&, ||, >, < etc)
* Loops (For and While)
* _any other concepts you learned along the way that was not taught can be included.  If you are using something that was **not** taught in class, be prepared to explain it in a conversation with your teacher_
